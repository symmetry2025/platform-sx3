# Symmetry Trainer — Cursor rules
#
# Goal: standalone trainers product with its own DB/auth/landing.
# IMPORTANT: do NOT put secrets here.

## Process (must-follow)
- No secrets committed; only `.env.example` and docs.
- FE ↔ BE must be same domain; API must be under `/api/*`.
- Frontend requests must use `credentials: 'include'`.
- Server-side RBAC is source of truth. Client-side guards are UX only.
